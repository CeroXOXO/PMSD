Project Title: Project Management System Development

Problem Statement:

Klick Inc. struggles with managing multiple projects simultaneously. Their current process of tracking tasks, managing resources, monitoring budgets, and communicating with team members is inefficient and prone to errors. The company needs a centralized Project Management System to help their teams organize work, assign tasks, monitor project progress, track budgets, and improve communication among team members and stakeholders.

Your task is to develop a Project Management System using React for the frontend and Laravel for the backend. The system should allow the company to create and manage projects, assign tasks, track progress, and generate reports. The project should be developed over a 5-sprint development cycle by a team of 5 members, each with defined roles and responsibilities.
